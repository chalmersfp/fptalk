Hej everyone!

On Monday we have a visitor from Columbia University, John Hui. He will present some resent work that is published at MEMOCODE 2023, in collaboration with Stephen A. Edwards and Kyle J. Edwards (http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/papers/hui2023timestamp.pdf). I think it will be of interest not just to us in the FP unit, but also the people in the CNS division. I have booked Analysen from 11:00 to 12:00, but there is also a zoom link (assuming the room equipment work): https://chalmers.zoom.us/j/67690149801 Password: fptalk

I hope to see many of you there!

Title: Timestamp Peripherals for Precise Real-Time Programming

Abstract: On microcontrollers, timer devices provide high-precision timing,
but that precision is lost when using high-level languages without
suitable abstractions for temporal behavior. So, for timing-sensitive
applications, programmers resort to low-level languages like C
which lack expressiveness and safety guarantees. Other program-
mers use specialized precision-timing hardware which is expensive
and difficult to obtain.
In this work, we achieve sub-microsecond precision from a high-
level real-time programming language on the RP2040, a cheap,
widely available microcontroller. Our work takes advantage of the
RP2040’s Programmable I/O (PIO) devices, which are cycle-accurate
coprocessors designed for implementing hardware protocols over
the RP2040’s GPIO pins.
We use the PIO devices to implement timestamp peripherals,
which are input capture and output compare devices. We use times-
tamp peripherals to mediate I/O from programs written in Sslang,
a real-time programming language with deterministic concurrency.
We show that timestamp peripherals help Sslang programs achieve
the precise timing behavior prescribed by Sslang’s Sparse Synchro-
nous Programming model.
