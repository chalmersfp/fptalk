Hej everyone! A friendly reminder that there's an FP-talk by John
Hughes in analysen at 11am today :)


John Hughes: I want a partial evaluator for Erlang

I’ve had a bee in my bonnet about this recently, but so far I don’t
have one, and–surprisingly–as far as I can tell, neither does anyone
else. The problem is Erlang’s concurrency. In the talk I’ll explain
what I want from a partial evaluator, why work from the past doesn’t
match up, and some of the interesting things that an Erlang partial
evaluator will need to be able to do.
