On Friday Yinan is giving a talk at the FP seminar slot :) It is at
11:00 in Analysen.

Below is the abstract for her talk:

Automated machine learning (AutoML) refers to the process of
automating data-driven learning algorithms. Typically, this topic
includes neural architecture search, hyperparameter optimization, and
meta-learning. One key component of AuthoML is to automatically search
for the optimal configuration of a machine learning algorithm, which
requires defining and parameterizing the search space with a domain
specific language. In this talk, I will provide a brief overview of
AutoML and some challenges from this perspective. I am looking forward
to receiving some feedback and exploring potential opportunities for
future collaboration.
