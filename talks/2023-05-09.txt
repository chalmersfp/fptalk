Next Tuesday, the 9th of May, we have a FP talk by Hrutvik Kanabar about PureCake!
It takes place at 11:00 in Analysen. 

I hope to see many of you there!

Title: PureCake: A Verified Compiler for a Lazy Functional Language
Speaker: Hrutvik Kanabar

This is a practice talk for PLDI'23, where Hrutvik (PhD student
at the University of Kent, UK) will present the following paper.
Hrutvik will be visiting Chalmers for Tue 9 and Wed 10 May.

PureCake: A Verified Compiler for a Lazy Functional Language

We present PureCake, a mechanically-verified compiler for PureLang, a
lazy, purely functional programming language with monadic
effects. PureLang syntax is Haskell-like and indentation-sensitive,
and its constraint-based Hindley-Milner type system guarantees safe
execution. We derive sound equational reasoning principles over its
operational semantics, dramatically simplifying some proofs. We prove
end-to-end correctness for the compilation of PureLang down to machine
code—the first such result for any lazy language—by targeting CakeML
and composing with its verified compiler. Multiple optimisation passes
are necessary to handle realistic lazy idioms effectively. We develop
PureCake entirely within the HOL4 interactive theorem prover.

This is joint work with: Samuel Vivien, Oskar Abrahamsson, Magnus
O. Myreen, Michael Norrish, Johannes Åman Pohjola, Riccardo Zanetti.
