On Friday the 28th a masters' student, Lawrence, will talk about the
BUBS runtime :) At 11:00 AM in Analysen. The presentation will detail
one corner of this masters' thesis, which will be presented in its
entirety closer to summer.

-- Lawrence's abstract

The BUBS runtime

Is garbage collection getting to you?
Are you stumped by STG?
Is runtime complexity ruining your research?

If so, come to Friday's FP talk, where I will present
Shivers & Wand 's BUBS algorithm for Î»-calculus reduction,
which is simple, fast, lazy, garbage-free, and supports open terms.
