On Friday, the 5th of May, we have a FP talk by Dhasarathy :)
It is at 11:00 AM in EDIT 5128

Foundation modeling beyond natural language - It's fair to say that
neural language processing is setting the pace in deep learning
today. Other domains like computer vision are quickly being left
behind. If other domains can't beat NLP, maybe it's time to join
'em. I'll focus upon two examples in how the toolkit pioneered in NLP
can be extended to other domains in automotive engineering. The first
is where we use unsupervised pre-training in the vision domain to
solve a task in vehicle dynamics. The second example is in the domain
of programming language where we use unsupervised pre-training and
some rule-based vector arithmetic to solve a task in software design.
