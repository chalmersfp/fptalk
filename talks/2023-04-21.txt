Hej everyone!

Tomorrow at 11:00 in EDIT 8103, Carl Seger will give an FP-talk

Title: Information Flow Control Analysis on Hardware for Timing Side-Channel detection.
 
Abstract: Information Flow Control (IFC) Analysis has proven to be
very powerful for analyzing how confidential information flow through
software. For hardware, the traditional approach is to add extra
circuitry that tracks the security level of the information as it
flows through the machine. The security level is usually defined as a
lattice and some approximation is used to compute the result when two
values of different security levels meet in some operation. There are
two main problems with this approach: 1) adding logic to a design is
rather costly in terms of area, routing and power, and 2) the approach
is often so conservative that many valid designs will be
rejected. Recently some attempts at using programming language type
IFC analysis on hardware description languages have been
proposed. Unfortunately, these are also quite conservative and will
reject many valid designs. An interesting idea for IFC analysis in
hardware is to use symbolic simulation, and symbolic trajectory
evaluation in particular. Here we leverage the names of the variables
used in the symbolic simulation to track the security level. We will
illustrate how this technique can be used to discover several types of
side channels.  Much of this talk is based on work I and Alejandro did
a few years ago and that I have taken up again.
