On Monday the 27th of March we have a FP-talk at 11:00 in
Analysen. Abhiroop will talk about our recent work on running Haskell
in TEE's. There will not be a FP talk on this coming Friday, the 24th,
as it clashes with Elisabet's PhD defence.


Title: HasTEE -- Confidential Computing on Trusted Execution Environments with Haskell

Abstract:

This talk presents HasTEE, a Domain-Specific Language in Haskell that
allows the seamless programming of hardware-enforced memory isolation
units called Trusted Execution Environment (TEEs). HasTEE provides a
typed, high-level programming model that automatically
compartmentalizes the confidential portions of a program on the TEE
unit, and then enforces lightweight Information Flow Control policies
to prevent unintentional leakage of secrets outside the TEE. We have
demonstrated the practicality of HasTEE through case studies on
Federated Learning and Differentially Private Data Clean Rooms. In the
final part of the talk, I will discuss how designing a
capability-constrained subset of Haskell could potentially remove
notions of ambient authority from a HasTEE application.
