On Wednesday the 26th of April, Troels Henriksen will give a FP-Talk at 10:00 in EDIT 8103

Title: Augmenting Hindley-Milner Type Inference with Array Language Features

Abstract: The Hindley-Milner type system is a true jewel; perfectly
balanced such that almost any extension will harming its important
properties.  In this talk I will about extending Hindley-Milner with a
notion of size-dependent types, suitable for encoding array programming
patterns.  The goal is to provide a type system that feels not much more
complicated than your standard Hindley-Milner-based language
(e.g. Standard ML), but provides some of the flexibility usually only
found in dependently typed languages.  The work is done in the context
of the Futhark programming language, and my talk will focus on the
intuition behind the properties and features we want such a type system
to have, as well as outlining our (currently only partially complete)
efforts at formalisation.
