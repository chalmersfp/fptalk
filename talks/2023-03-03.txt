Patrik Jansson: Level-p-complexity of Boolean Functions: Using thinning, memoization, and polynomials

Abstract

This talk presents a function for computing level-$p$-complexity of
Boolean functions, and applies it to two-level iterated majority. The
function is specified as a classical optimisation problem: first
generate all candidates, then pick the best one. To make this function
efficient we we use use thinning and memoization and for seperation of
concerns we use type classes. The complexity is represented using
polynomials, and the order relation used for thinning is implemented
using polynomial factorisation and root-counting.  (Joint work with
Julia Jansson, MV, Chalmers.)
